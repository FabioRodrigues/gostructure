# GOstructure

This repository proposes to be an scaffolding repo to get some architectural patterns applied on go

## Architectures

To exeplify these patterns, I'll solve a single `BDD` scenario aplying each of below patterns:

- DDD (developing)

### Future:
- MVC
- Clean architecture
- Transaction script


## Problem

The BDD is:

```
Given I want to reserve a book in a book store
When I reserve the book
And there is just one available book
Then the book has to be unavailable
```
